## Got it 👍 — you’re basically describing a Generative AI workflow embedded inside GaneshFest. Let’s break this down cleanly from a solution-architecture view (since this isn’t trivial):

🎯 User Journey

Customer/Vendor Interaction
User speaks (voice) or types to the AI assistant.
Example: “I want a 3-foot Ganesh idol, sitting posture, pink lotus base, modern style.”

AI Idol Design Suggestion
Backend sends prompt → AI Image Generation (e.g. Stable Diffusion, DALL·E, or custom fine-tuned model).
Returns multiple sample images (tiles).
Customer Selection
Customer picks a design → adds to Cart → Checkout.
Vendor Fulfillment
Order event → Kafka → Vendor Portal (assigned vendor sees design + specs).
Vendor gets reference design image + structured details (size, materials, delivery date).

🏗️ Solution Architecture (Extended GaneshFest)
Frontend (React + Vite + Tailwind + UnoCSS)
AI Design Menu in side-nav (AI Special Services)
🎤 Voice input (Web Speech API / browser mic capture).

✍️ Text prompt input.
📷 Tile gallery for AI-generated idol samples.

🛒 “Add to Cart” integration with existing flow.

Backend (Spring Boot)
New service: AI Design Service
Exposes /api/ai/design endpoint.
Calls AI model API (OpenAI, Stable Diffusion server, or HuggingFace inference).
Stores generated image metadata in Postgres (link to image, prompt, customer, etc).
Existing Order Service extended:
Accepts “AI custom product” with designId.
Publishes Kafka order event tagged with "ai-generated".
Database (Postgres)

ai_designs table:

id | customer_id | prompt | image_url | selected boolean | created_at

Kafka (Event-driven flow)

Topic: ganeshfest-ai-orders

Publishes: { designId, customerId, vendorId, imageUrl, specs }

Vendor apps subscribe → get assigned work.

Keycloak (Security)

Add ROLE_VENDOR and ROLE_CUSTOMER.

Vendors can only see AI orders assigned to them.

Customers only see their own AI designs + order history.

🧠 AI Integration Options

OpenAI / Azure OpenAI API – Easiest, high quality (paid).

Stable Diffusion (Self-hosted, e.g. AUTOMATIC1111 or ComfyUI) – More control, can fine-tune on Ganesh idols dataset.

HuggingFace diffusers + GPU server – DIY hosting with flexibility.

🔮 Future Enhancements
3D Models (GLTF/OBJ) → Vendors get printable/sculptable 3D references.
Augmented Reality preview → Customers “place” the idol in their home before ordering.
AI-optimized cost estimates (size, material, delivery time).

⚡ So, you’re essentially moving GaneshFest into a “Generative Commerce” app → customers co-create idols with AI, vendors fulfill orders with precision.

👉 Do you want me to scaffold the AI service endpoints in Spring Boot (with placeholder API call to OpenAI / Stable Diffusion) so you can plug in later?

## CREATE TABLE product (
    id BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255),
    description TEXT,
    price DOUBLE PRECISION,
    category VARCHAR(255)
);

## CREATE TABLE product_images (
    product_id BIGINT NOT NULL,
    image_url VARCHAR(255),
    FOREIGN KEY (product_id) REFERENCES product(id)
    );

Here, product_images is a simple key-value store (no primary key, just product_id + image_url).
👉 Good if images are just URLs.

##  Add Sub-Category
    ALTER TABLE product DROP CONSTRAINT product_category_check;

    ALTER TABLE product
    ADD CONSTRAINT product_category_check
    CHECK (
        (category = 'IDOLS' AND sub_category IN ('CLAY', 'ASBESTOS'))
        OR (category = 'FOOD' AND sub_category IN ('TIFFINS', 'MAIN_COURSE'))
        OR (category = 'POOJA' AND sub_category IN ('POOJAKIT','KALASHAM'))
        OR (category = 'FLOWER' AND sub_category IN ('GARLAND','LOOSE','SMALL','MEDIUM','LARGE','GAZA_MALA'))
        OR (category = 'IMMERSION' AND sub_category IN ('DRUMS','DJ','TRUCK'))
        OR (category = 'TENT_HOUSE' AND sub_category IN ('CARPET','CHAIRS','TABLES','UTMSILS','TENT','SIDE_TENT'))
        -- add others as needed
    );
